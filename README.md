# Naughty Words Every Programmer Should Know

> Programming books don’t have to be boring.  
> Or polite.

**Naughty Words Every Programmer Should Know** rips the plastic wrap off software development’s most overused principles and repackages them as unforgettable, slightly NSFW acronyms you’ll actually remember.

Forget lifeless lectures and sterile acronyms.  
This book blends **hard-won engineering wisdom** with the kind of **gallows humor only developers understand**.

## What’s inside?

From **S.H.I.T.** (“Stop Hunting In Tests”) to **P.I.S.S.** (“Prove It’s Simple, Stupid”), you’ll find:

- No-BS explanations of real engineering principles  
- War stories from actual projects (the kind you don’t hear at conferences)
- Honest takes on why some “best practices” quietly destroy codebases
- Practical advice for writing software that survives contact with reality

This is not theory-first software engineering.  
This is **what actually works**.

---

## Who is this for?

- Junior developers trying to avoid painful rookie mistakes
- Mid-level devs drowning in process theater
- Senior engineers who’ve seen things and are tired of pretending otherwise

If you’ve ever thought *“this sounds great on slides, but will explode in production”* — this book is for you.

## Why this book exists

Most programming advice is:
- Over-sanitized
- Over-abstracted
- Under-tested in the real world

This book exists to say the quiet parts out loud — with humor, clarity, and zero corporate polish.

## ⚠️ Warning

Contains:
- Strong language
